    - Require Perl 5.006 to get pack 'q' for quads.  C'mon, it's been over a decade now.
    - Support packing and unpacking of full range of signed and unsigned integer values,
        though broker differences may make their use problematic.
    - Fix signedness of integer packing and unpacking (signed were treated as unsigned).
    - Introduce Net::AMQP::Value::* classes to control packing of table values.
    - In tables, pack and unpack undefs as void and values from the "boolean" class as bools.
    - Support decoding the Heartbeat frame type.
    - Include AMQP 0-9-1 spec.
    - Document that AMQP 0-9, 0-9-1, and 0-10 specs can be used, though support is not complete.
    - New co-maintainer Chip Salzenberg.
