NAME
    Net::AMQP - Advanced Message Queue Protocol (de)serialization and
    representation

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::AMQP;

      Net::AMQP::Protocol->load_xml_spec('amqp0-8.xml');

      ...

      my @frames = Net::AMQP->parse_raw_frames(\$input);
  
      ...

      foreach my $frame (@frames) {
          if ($frame->can('method_frame') && $frame->method_frame->isa('Net::AMQP::Protocol::Connection::Start')) {
              my $output = Net::AMQP::Frame::Method->new(
                  channel => 0,
                  method_frame => Net::AMQP::Protocol::Connection::StartOk->new(
                      client_properties => { ... },
                      mechanism         => 'AMQPLAIN',
                      locale            => 'en_US',
                      response          => {
                          LOGIN    => 'guest',
                          PASSWORD => 'guest',
                      },
                  ),
              );
              print OUT $output->to_raw_frame();
          }
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the frame (de)serialization and representation of
    the Advanced Message Queue Protocol (http://www.amqp.org/). It is to be
    used in conjunction with client or server software that does the actual
    TCP/IP communication.

CLASS METHODS
  parse_raw_frames
      Net::AMQP->parse_raw_frames(\$binary_payload)

    Given a scalar reference to a binary string, return a list of
    Net::AMQP::Frame objects, consuming the data in the string. Croaks on
    invalid input.

SEE ALSO
    Net::AMQP::Value, Net::RabbitMQ, AnyEvent::RabbitMQ, Net::RabbitFoot,
    POE::Component::Client::AMQP

AMQP VERSIONS
    AMQP 0-8 is fully supported.

    AMQP 0-9, 0-9-1, and 0-10 are usably supported. There are
    interoperability issues with table encodings because the standard
    disagrees with the dialects of major implementations (RabbitMQ and
    Qpid). For now, Net::AMQP limits itself to universally agreed table
    elements. See <http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-errata.html> for
    details.

    AMQP 1.0 has not been tested.

TODO
    Address the dialect problem, either via modified spec files that
    completely control the wire protocol, or by programmatic request. The
    former has precedent (viz "qpid.amqp0-8.xml" in spec), but could cause a
    combinatorial explosion as more brokers and versions are added. The
    latter adds interface complexity.
